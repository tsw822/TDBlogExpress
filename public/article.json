Make the most of the chilly weather and take your family ice skating for some active, wintery fun. If you don't live near a real skating rink, look for faux-ice options&mdash;many towns set up temporary outdoor rinks, especially for the holidays! Ice skating can be tricky for younger children and older adults, so make sure everyone is comfortable with the activity. Otherwise, lace up your skates and get ready for some fun!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Before start, check these will be very helpful:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Make sure your child&rsquo;s skates are comfortable, fit well, and are not too tight.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure your child is warm enough. As with all winter sports, nobody has fun if they are cold.</li>\r\n<li>Keep it short when starting out! Skating is exhausting for young kids.</li>\r\n<li>Prepare Candy or Chocolate,as prize to the game.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>How to have fun while skating, there are 7 games on ice welcomed by kids:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Red light, green light: skate when the leader says green light, stop when the leader says red light, as you race/toddle to the finish line.</li>\r\n<li>ABC hunt: Scatter foam ABC letters around the ice and have the kids search for them in order. They must practice bending over and standing up again to pick up each letter. As a bonus, they work on early literacy skil</li>\r\n<li>Chocolate hunt: Same as ABC game above but scatter chocolate eggs, kisses, or other candy around the ice for the kids to pick up.</li>\r\n<li>Stuffed animal game: place a bunch of stuffed animals on the ice with a plastic bin at the far end. Kids have to carry the animal down the ice and place it in the bin. Skate back for the next animal and repeat. Plastic bin comes in handy when transporting animals to the ice as well.</li>\r\n<li>Set up an obstacle course with pool noodles, hula hoops, pylons, or other objects the kids must skate around</li>\r\n<li>Draw lines on the ice and have kids follow the lines. Vary it up with squiggly lines, circles, snails, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Ice Soccer: Like hockey but with a ball. Set up some nets or pylons and have the kids kick a ball to practice transferring weight from one foot to the other. Can be played as a team or just individually kicking the ball up and down the ice.</li>\r\n<li>Hockey: Kids love hockey sticks. Bring some plastic hockey sticks or invest in child-sized wooden sticks. Get the kids hitting a soft puck or a ball around the ice. And again, it can be played as a team game or just between parent and child.</li>\r\n</ul>","image":"Ice_Skating.jpg","abstract":"Skating is the perfect family sport.
